description: Load Serban's Obsidian vault (long-term memory) for the website www.fahrlehrer-serband.de - his profile, binding working rules and the project overview. Use at the start of every session, or when context about Serban, past decisions or project history is needed.
allowed-tools: Bash(cat *)

Below is the start context from Serban's vault (`/home/user/obsidian-vault`).
If it says VAULT NOT FOUND: call `add_repo` (owner `serband1995-hue`, repo `obsidian-vault`, access `push`), clone it to `/home/user/obsidian-vault`, then run /vault again.

After loading: confirm in one short German sentence that the vault is loaded, then wait for Serban's task. Read further notes only when the task needs them (use the index). Never read the whole vault.
